Woohoo! Well it's been a while hasn't it? I had such delusions of blogging
grandeur, but alas it's been a good 6 months since my last post. Let's
remedy that, shall we?

## First things first

What fun, exciting stuff has happened in the span of 6 months? Well, in
(roughly) chronological order with some pictures, here are some things that
have taken up a large portion of those 6 months:

Liechtenstein ( No pictures... yet! )

## So what's next?

Sounds like a pretty exciting six months, right? Well I've only just
begun! I'll be spending the next 3 months in Liechtenstein, a fantastically
small country in the heart of Europe, working as an intern developing
iPhone applications for the Hilti Corporation.

From here on out, I'll reminisce about past events and ponder about the
present. You'll see some neat pictures depicting my many travels across the
grand continent of Europe, some tidbits here and there pertaining to random
side projects, and... more? Stay tuned!
