I've been working on a game side-project for the past year as a fun way to
really deep dive into [Rust][rust], [Amethyst][amethyst], and different
game dev topics such as AI, pathfinding, shaders, etc. The game utilizes an
isometric 2.5D view much like SimCity 3000 or Civilization, all from
pre-rendered sprites.

As I was working on the map generation and rendering, I found a couple
tutorials that went through a basic isometric projection with tiles, but
nothing that did it in a way that was generalizable to different view
points. Due to the progress I've made thus far with my own game, I decided
to do a little writeup (with examples!) to showcase how to go from a grid
of points to an isometric projection with different orientations.

Below I have a full example that has been rebuilt in WebGL with different toggles
to visualize each step of the transformation.

## From grid to projection

Standard isometric projection has it where if we started with the front
face of an object, it would be rotated 45 degrees around the vertical axis
and then approximately 35 degrees around the horizontal axis. After these
transformations, the objects should look roughly like the different shapes
in the image below:

![isometric shapes](/img/2019/isometric-projection.png)
*Example of different 3D shapes isometrically projected. Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isometric_projection)*

Before we began, some assumptions:

* Tiles will be sprites that are already rendered with the isometric look
  (Ã  la SimCity 3000).
* The tile grid is represented by a 2D array.
* The camera being used is an orthographic camera.

Assuming the grid to be in Euclidean space where `(0,0)` is
at the bottom left, the 2D array of tiles we'll be using in our example
will be represented roughly like the code snippet below:

``` javascript
enum Tiles = {
    GRASS,
    DIRT
};

let map = [
    // row 0, col 0; row 0, col 1, etc.
    [Tiles.GRASS, Tiles.GRASS, ...]
    ...
];
```

We can loop through each row and column and render each tile of the grid at
their respective `(col, row)` point to get something basic on screen.

``` javascript
let geometry = new THREE.PlaneGeometry( 32, 32 );

let even = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({ color: 0xff0000 });
let odd = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({ color: 0x00ff00 });

for (let y = 0; y < grid.length; y++) {
    for (let x = 0; x < grid[y].length; x++) {
        let tile = new THREE.Mesh(
            geometry,
            (x + y) % 2 ? even : odd
        );

        tile.position.x = x;
        tile.position.y = y;

        scene.add(tile);
    }
}
```

When the above code is run (see the repo for the full code snippet), we'll
get something that looks roughly like so:

![Basic grid example](/img/2019/grid-example.png)
*The example grid rendered with 32x32 width tiles at each respective
`(col, row)` point*

As you can see, without any modification to how we place the tiles
everything will overlap with each other. To go from this to the isometric
projection we want, we're going to have to apply a series of
[_transforms_][transform-wiki] that will translate, scale, and rotate the
tiles to their correct positions.

### ðŸ¤” What are transforms?

In linear algebra, a transform or transformation matrix refers to a linear
mapping between some set of points to another set of points. Typically,
these linear transformations can be composed (i.e. applied one after
another through multiplication) and inverted (e.g. to map a point back to
some original grid).

In computer graphics, there are certain matrices that can be used to apply
a rotation, scaling, or translation. It is with these matrices that we'll
begin our journey towards the final isometric projection.


### Applying the transforms

Since the sprites being used are already pre-rendered the isometric projection.
We only need to apply the following transforms:

1. Translating the grid such that the origin is in the center of the grid.
2. Scaling the grid to match the sprite size.
3. Rotating the grid around the vertical axis by 45 degrees.

Above is an example of scaling the grid to the correct tile size, with the
tiles attached

And here is the scaled grid after we rotate grid by 45 degree and the scale
the grid so that the tiles overlap each other correctly.


## Rotating to different view points

Armed with this knowledge, rotating the view for each different
orientations of the grid is as easy as applying another rotation transform
before we convert the grid into the isometric projection.

If we intend to mimic the rotation of SimCity 3000, there are only
four set rotations, one for each corner of the map. This means from our
initial view we will either be rotating 90 degrees clockwise, 90 degrees
counter clockwise, or 180 degrees.

In matrix form, a rotation matrix would look like so:

$$
R = \begin{bmatrix}
    \cos(\theta) & -\sin(\theta) \\\\
    \sin(\theta) & \cos(\theta) \\\\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

Applied to some point `(x, y)`:

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
    \cos(\theta) & -\sin(\theta) \\\\
    \sin(\theta) & \cos(\theta)
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
    x \\\\
    y \\\\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

And multiplied out:

$$
x' = x \cos(\theta) - y \sin(\theta) \\\\
y' = x \sin(\theta) + y \cos(\theta)
$$

Now in code, this would look like so for some angle `rot`:

``` javascript
let cos_rot = Math.cos(rot);
let sin_rot = Math.sin(rot);

let rx = (cx * cos_rot) - (cy * sin_rot);
let ry = (cx * sin_rot) + (cy * cos_rot);
```

For each rotation event, all we need to do is update the `rot` angle that is
used to rotate the initial view and update the placement of each tile. As long
as we have an idea of how large our grid will be, we can apply these transformations
no matter where we're viewing the grid and have the terrain correctly rotate at the
location we're viewing.


## Putting it all together

Combining the rotation with the earlier scaling and isometric projection, we get
the following code:

``` javascript
// Center grid on the origin
let cx = x - GRID_WIDTH;
let cy = y - GRID_HEIGHT;

// Rotate around new origin
let cos_rot = Math.cos(rot);
let sin_rot = Math.sin(rot);

let rx = (cx * cos_rot) - (cy * sin_rot);
let ry = (cx * sin_rot) + (cy * cos_rot);

// Scale and rotate one last time to get into iso view.
// NOTE: Since a rotation of 45 degrees makes it so
// sin = cos = 0.707, I factor out the value since all
// it's doing is scaling the grid down.
let px = (rx - ry) * TILE_WIDTH / 2
let py = (rx + ry) * TILE_HEIGHT / 2;
let pz = -(rx + ry);

return [px, py, pz];
```

And there you have it! We've built an isometric view that also allows us to
rotate everything however we please.
