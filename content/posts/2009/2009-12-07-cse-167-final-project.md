CSE 167 is a course I'm taking this quarter having to do with Computer
Graphics. We've been working with OpenGL creating cool scenes while
learning more about the underlying concepts. It's loads of work, but loads
of fun as well.

To end the quarter, our final project is to come up with a cool scene using
a variety of effects.

My scene will consist of a procedurally generated planet with some
procedurally generated floral life. You should be able to zoom down onto
the planet and walk around and enjoy the sights. The real beauty of the
project is that the entire scene will be rendered in such a way that it
looks like it's been hand drawn, like a sketch or painting.

Attached is the latest version of the planet generator with a really basic
version of the shader that will turn the scene into a hand drawn
masterpiece. Next on the list of things to do is populating the planet with
the generated trees I've created. At the end of all this, I'll be putting
some articles on how I worked through each part, with code and plenty of
screen shots documenting my progress =).

Til then, you'll have to make do with this single screen shot =P
