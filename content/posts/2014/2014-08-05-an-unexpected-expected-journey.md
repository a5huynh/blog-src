For as long as I could remember I have always wanted to *create*. To create
programs, to create art, to create ideas -- to just create! And these creations
never had to be in any creative or even practical capacity. Hell, they
don't even have to be good or useful in anyway. There lay an incredible
feeling of joy in my ability to make something that did not exist before.

Stemming from these notions, it always seemed to me that the natural state
of my progression would be towards entrepreneurship. These were folks who
were the ultimate creators. From nothing but sweat, blood, and tears their
ideas were turned into tangible goods and services that have added some
sort of value to thousands if not millions of lives.

And now here I am, in San Francisco trying to do just that. I, along with a
good friend of mine, are in two well-known accelerators in the heart of
city. We are turning what have been grand visions, grand ideas, and grand
delusions into something more tangible. And while the honeymoon period
hasn't quite ended, the stress and the fear is bubbling up.


## Imposter Syndrome

> I feel the pressure, under more scrutiny, <br>
> and what I do? Act more stupidly.

I always felt a tinge of what I would later find out to be called the
[imposter syndrome](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome). For
most of my life I have felt lucky. Lucky to have parents who have looked
out for me, lucky to have been placed in crazy opportune moments, lucky to
have gathered the skills that placed me in the very position I am now.
Behind all this luck, there lies doubt. Doubt that someday that luck which
has brought me so much will finally run out. It's a truly terrifying thought.

Every extra slice of success adds to the tension. Parents expect more. Friends
expect more. People expect more. And perhaps worse of all, I expect more. Its
easy to see how it can all go wrong, but what happens when it all goes right?


## The Long Road Ahead

> All for freedom and for pleasure <br>
> Nothing ever lasts forever <br>
> Everybody wants to rule the world.

Demo day is a long ways away. A lot can happen between now and then.
Everyone is currently all hopped on energy and the newness of it all. The
impending crunch is barely on the horizon.

Looking back, I felt it would be interesting to document the ups and downs
over the next couple months. Writing helps put the whirlwind of thoughts
and emotions into something coherent. At the very least it'll be
therapeutic. Maybe someone out there will find it useful. Maybe someone
else in the same situation will stumble upon this and feel some sort of
solidarity. All I know is that there is a vast unknown in front of me and a
long difficult journey ahead.

But boy is it exciting.
