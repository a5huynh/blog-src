Amid the flurry of preparation for a new year, I sat down to reflect upon the
one that has just passed. Every year I enter the next a little more optimistic
and a little more excited. Part of it due to the potential of unknown unknowns
(be it good or bad), and part of it due to thought of spending another year
with those that I truly care about and those that I enjoy being around.

Admittedly, this coming year feels a little more precarious. The future is
perhaps a little hazier than it ever has been. It is staggering in sheer
potential and frightening in sheer responsbility. And while I no longer try to
extrapolate in full the events that will happen in the near future, I can only
imagine the best. For me, for those around me, and for those not-so-around me.


## Here's to You

I've meet some truly wonderful people over the past year. All of whom I have no
doubt will succeed one way or another. To all those folks at 500 Startups and
Code for America, I look forward to hearing about great results and even
greater successes.

For my friends, near and far, I hope the new year brings many more views just like the one below. To pushing boundaries, both physically and mentally,
and creating experiences like no other.

While we may not always make it from point A to point B, I can't think of
anyone else I'd rather spend those in-between moments of daring, adventure, and
perhaps most importantly silliness.

And finally to my family. Many of whom don't quite ever understand what I do on
a day to day basis, but are still quite understanding nonetheless.

New Year? Let's rock and roll.
