For those who don't know, I'm currently the President of the Computer
Science and Engineering Society here at UCSD. We have multiple projects
that we run each year and numerous events (such as programming contests,
game nights, etc).

<!-- more -->

One of our projects this year is an attempt to build a fully functional
Multitouch table, very similar to the Microsoft Surface. The only
difference is that we're building everything from the ground up. This is
including the actual table itself with all its hardware, a framework to
interact with the table, and finally an API for developers to write
applications for the table.

Whats great is that we'll be releasing as much information/tools/code as we
can as we continually work on the project.

We're currently in our "prototype" phase, as we hammer out the details for
our much larger table. In parallel, we're also slowly ramping up
development of our framework/API and learning a lot in the process.

Last Saturday (November 22nd, 2008) was a significant day as we all got
together (around 12 of us) to build our second prototype. Our first
prototype was very much a hack and was put together rather hastily to
actually prove that our method would work. The second prototype is a lot
easier to move around and set up, and hopefully will allow us to garner a
little support for our endeavor.

I'll try to post as many updates of our progress as I can. I should have a
little more time for such follies next quarter
