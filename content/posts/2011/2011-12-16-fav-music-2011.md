Every December I make a list of my favorite songs from the past year. Or at
least I try. My musical tastes are eclectic and sometimes a little quirky
which makes creating a list and checking it twice not so very nice. But
enough talk! On to the music! Most of these picks were released this year,
but there are the occasional that are not.

A little note: I'm not that picky about genres since it's such an arbitrary
label so everything is clumped together into general categories.

A large note: Might take a while to load the page with all these YouTube
embeddings present.

## Rock/Indie Rock

It's been a fantastic year for my first love, so it's no surprise that most
of fav's this year make it into this category.

### The Black Keys (El Camino) ###
Fuck it. All I was doing was adding every song off of the Black Keys'
latest album, so I'm declaring the entire album fantastic and you're just
going to have to live with that. Some highlights

### Best Coast - When I'm With You ###
Not really from 2011 but since they visited UCSD this year for our Sun God
Festival here's a little nod towards an excellent indie outfit from Los
Angeles.

### Belle and Sebastian - I Want The World To Stop ###
I love that little riff in the beginning.

### Bon Iver - I Can't Make You Love Me ###
Just heart wrenching.

### Handsome Furs - No Feeling ###

## Pop/Indie Pop

Some of these could've went into the indie category too. I hate trying to fit things into categories.

### Cults - Abducted ###

### Foster the People - Houdini ###
Everybody and their grandmother has heard [Pumped Up The Kicks](http://www.google.com), so I'm going to go for something different.

### Yelle - Que Veux-Tu ( Madeon Remix ) ###
Catchy french pop. Need I say more?

## Electronic/Etc.

### Chromeo - Hot Mess ( w/ La Roux ) ###
The electrofunk duo at their very best.

### Kavinsky - Nightcall ###
I heard this as the opener track for the great, excellent, awesome movie
[Drive](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0780504/). The rest of the soundtrack
is absolutely fantastic ( honestly a little reminiscent of the Tron
soundtrack ).

### Madeon - Pop Culture ###
16/17 years of age and *already* considered one of the best electronic producers around.
