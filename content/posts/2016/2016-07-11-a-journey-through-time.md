2015 has come and gone in a hurry and we are already 1/2th of the
way into 2016. Reflecting on the past year it seems as if the list of things I
wish to accomplish has grown larger and the time in which to accomplish them
seems to have grown shorter. Startups tend to do that.

I remember times in my early years where there was nothing I wouldn't give to
drop everything and work on a startup. It felt incredibly exciting. Here were
people just like me, creating things that thousands if not millions of people
could use. Of course, looking back I would say it was a bit naive and a very
romanticized perspective on how those sort of things would work. Paul Graham
makes a poignant statement in his essay [Before The Startup][before_startups]
about how your early 20s are a horrible time to begin a startup. Among other
reasons, you'd be missing out on all those serendipitous things that happen in
your early 20s. Backpacking around some unknown country, skipping class/work to
hack on an interesting side project, or perhaps even both at the same time.

When I started my transition, it was one of optimistic hesistation. There was
little doubt in my mind that this would be and will be a truly exciting period
of time; The spectre that haunted me however was the continual fear of losing
touch with the very people who played a role in bringing me to this point. You
spend 12-14 hours a day intensely focused on a set of tasks, only to come back
the next day to do the very same. Days, weeks, months, years pass and when you
finally stop and wonder, "*where did the time go?*", the time is already lost.
Birthdays pass. Friends get married. Saying _"See you later?"_ starts feeling
more like just _"goodbye"_.
